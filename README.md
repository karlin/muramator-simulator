muramator-simulator
===================

This is a simulation of the neural subsumption architecture of Jonathan Connell's Muramator robot.

I originally read about it in [an Electronics Hobbyist magazine article][1] that got my interest as a 5th grader.

## Running the simulation

    yarn install
    yarn run gulp watch
    open http://localhost:8080/build/muramator.html
